# GraphiQL Chrome extension

Making the great [GraphiQL tool](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) available anywhere as a Chrome extension.

Based on the [GraphiQL example code](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/master/examples/graphiql-webpack).

This project is a fork of the seemingly unmaintained https://github.com/ermanc/ChromeiQL to keep the project up-to-date.
It aims to stay simple feature-wise and be the thinnest wrapper around GraphiQL as possible.
